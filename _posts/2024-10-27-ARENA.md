### XR Engineer (Research), Wise Lab, Carnegie Mellon University, PA

- **Enhanced Render Fusion (Remote Renderer Pipeline)**  
  Improved real-time translational performance by reducing latency during camera transitions, achieving a **30% increase in responsiveness and efficiency** in dynamic 3D object rendering.

- **Transition to OpenGL and FFmpeg with NVENC**  
  Shifted the remote rendering-streaming process from WebGL to OpenGL, leveraging FFmpeg with NVENC for encoding. This resulted in a native application that enables **smoother, lower-latency video streams** for server encoding and client decoding.

- **Development of Native VR Renderer**  
  Built a native VR Renderer using OpenXR, supporting the loading of 3D objects as **meshes, textures, and lighting elements**, ensuring seamless integration and improved performance for XR applications.

- **Recorder Class Design**  
  Engineered a Recorder class to capture frames and store them in a separate thread, **maintaining consistent frame rates** and minimizing performance bottlenecks.

- **Animator Class Creation**  
  Developed an Animator class to interpret metadata from configuration files, providing effective control over **animation speed and camera orientation** for an enhanced user experience and increased application flexibility.
